# LinkedListC
Linked list implementation i had to write for my university
in the C programming language.

## **Efficiency:
| **Operation** | **Big O** |
|----|----|
| *Insert:*     | Constant time O(1)|
| *Append:*     | Constant time O(1)|
| *FindItem:*     | Quadratic O(n^2)|
| *deleteItem:*     | Quadratic O(n^2)|
| *deleteList:*     | Quadratic O(n^2)|
These are worst-case runtimes i might add.
